Educational Experiment

# Project goal

The goal of this project is to create a distributed scalable social media website clone using Java. We will start this project by creating a single-server application using the Spring framework. This project is purely educational and should not be used in any commercial circumstances. You are free to do whatever you want with the source code according to the license of this project, but we explicitly do not care how well it works for you.

# Achieving our goal

We aim to achieve our goal without looking into current implementations. We want to evaluate naive approaches and document our progress step by step. We will certainly make bad decicions, we will create horrible and lousy code, we will have missing tests. We will probably even change our original objectives. Our documentation will be lacking, but we will aim to document each and every step. This project is as much about cowboy style programming as it is about learning and teaching through trial and error.
