# Project goal

The goal of this project is to create a distributed scalable social media website clone using Java. We will start this project by creating a single-server application using the Spring framework. This project is purely educational and should not be used in any commercial circumstances. You are free to do whatever you want with the source code according to the license of this project, but we explicitly do not care how well it works for you.
